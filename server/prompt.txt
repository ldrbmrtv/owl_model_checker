Task: Instantiate the OWL ontology from [onto] by creating OWL NamedIndividuals based on the data from [data], following the structure defined in [schema]

Input files:
-[onto] – Defines the ontology with predefined classes, relationships, and properties.
-[data] – Contains the dataset to be instantiated.
-[schema] – Specifies the structure and constraints of the dataset.
Requirements:
-The output must be a valid OWL ontology in Turtle (.ttl) format.
-Preserve the original ontology and incorporate the newly created individuals.
-Use only classes, relationships, and properties defined in onto.txt.
-Include all relevant data from test-case-cleaned.json.
Deliverable:
-A .ttl file containing the ontology with instantiated individuals.
